# ApplicationShield
Sample code for the ESP32 DevkitC 32D and HTPAd Application Shield (written in the Arduino IDE).
 
In this repository you will find programs for all supported HTPAd sensors.
Please choose the correct program folder for your sensor. You have to replace the dummy def.h file in the folder with the matching one from the all_sensor_defs folder.
Otherwise the program will use a wrong lookup table and you are not able to observe correct pixel temperatures.
